            <h1>MS Dhoni</h1>
            <h2>Mahendra Singh Dhoni</h2>
            <p><strong>Born:</strong> 7 July 1981</p>
            <p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni is an Indian professional cricketer who plays as a right-handed batter and a
                wicket-keeper. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest wicket-keeper batsmen and captains.</p>
            <p>He led India to win the 2007 T20 World Cup, 2011 World Cup, and 2013 Champions Trophy. Dhoni captained
                India in limited overs from 2007–2017 and in Tests from 2008–2014.</p>
            <p>Born in Ranchi, he made his first-class debut in 1999 and international debut in 2004. He retired from
                Test cricket in 2014 but played ODIs and T20s until 2019. He has scored over 17,000 runs
                in international cricket.</p>
            <p>In the Indian Premier League (IPL), Dhoni plays for Chennai Super Kings (CSK), leading them to the final
                on ten occasions and winning it five times (2010, 2011, 2018, 2021 and 2023 )
                jointly sharing this title with Rohit Sharma . He has also led CSK to two Champions League T20 titles in
                2010 and 2014. Dhoni is among the few batsmen to have scored more than five
                thousand runs in the IPL, as well as being the first wicket-keeper to do so.</p>
            <p>In 2008, Dhoni was awarded India's highest sport honour Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna
                Award by Government of India. He received the fourth highest civilian award Padma Shri in 2009 and
                third highest civilian award Padma Bhushan in 2018. Dhoni holds an honorary rank of Lieutenant
                colonel in the Parachute Regiment of the Indian Territorial Army which was presented to him by the
                Indian Army in 2011.</p>
